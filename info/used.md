**How it is used:**

The concepts presented in this mission are the exact sorts of concepts used in navigational software,
enabling a ship or plane to understand where it is,
where it must go and how far it has gone. 
Along the same vein, Global Positioning Satellites use similar principles to
provide pinpoint accurate locations to GPS receivers for use in navigation.
